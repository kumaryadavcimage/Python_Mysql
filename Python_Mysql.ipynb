    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval and manipulation. Databases can store information related to various domains, such as business, education, research, and more. They play a crucial role in managing and maintaining large volumes of data, providing mechanisms for storing, retrieving, updating, and managing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a structured format for defining and manipulating data. Key features of SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are structured and follow a predefined schema, where tables are defined with a fixed set of columns and data types. The relationships between tables are established using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.ACID Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases adhere to ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring reliable and transactional data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases traditionally use vertical scaling, where a single powerful server is employed to handle increased load. While horizontal scaling is possible, it may require more effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide a more flexible and scalable approach to data storage. Key features of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.Schema-less:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are schema-less, allowing for flexible and dynamic data models. Each record (document, key-value pair, etc.) can have its own structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.CAP Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases follow the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance), which states that it is impossible to achieve all three aspects simultaneously. NoSQL databases often prioritize either consistency or availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing for the distribution of data across multiple nodes or servers. They can handle large amounts of data and traffic efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases come in various types, including document-oriented (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), column-family stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases have a fixed schema, requiring a predefined structure for tables and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are schema-less, allowing for flexible and dynamic data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use a tabular structure with rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases support various data models, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.ACID Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases adhere to ACID properties, ensuring transactional consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases may sacrifice strict consistency for improved availability and partition tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases typically use vertical scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling, allowing for distributed data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.Examples:\n",

    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query generally follows a specific sequence. Here's the typical order:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.SELECT: The SELECT clause is used to specify the columns that should be retrieved in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.FROM: The FROM clause indicates the table or tables from which the data should be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.JOIN: If the query involves joining multiple tables, the JOIN clause is used to specify the conditions for the join operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.WHERE: The WHERE clause filters the rows based on specified conditions. It is used to retrieve only the rows that meet certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used for grouping rows based on specified columns. It is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "f.HAVING: The HAVING clause filters the grouped rows based on conditions. It is similar to the WHERE clause but is used with grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "g.ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It can sort in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "h.LIMIT / OFFSET: The LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned in the result set, while the OFFSET clause is used to skip a certain number of rows from the beginning.\n",
